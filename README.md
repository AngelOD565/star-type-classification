# star-type-classification

This independent Python project is a Kaggle notebook that analyzes a datset of 240 different stars. Parameters of the stars include temperature, luminosity, radius, absolute magnitude, star type, color, and spectral class. This project is self-inspired as I have a passion for astrophysics and cosmology. The project mainly focuses on being able to extract data from datasets into dataframes  for further analysis. Analyses include description of the dataframe, visualization using plots and diagrams of different aspects of the data, inferences from the data, and plotting the famous H-R Diagram for stars. I used a number of Python libraries, namely NumPy, Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib. I hope to be able to apply machine learning techniques to this dataset in the future when I become more proficient in AI/ML.
